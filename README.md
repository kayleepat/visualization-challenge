# Pymaceuticals, Inc. Study

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze the results of a clinical study conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. which aimed to identify potential SCC skin cancer treatments in mice. This study involved 249 mice that underwent various drug regimens and the results were compared to Capomulin, Pymaceuticals' drug of interest.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Analysis
Capomulin performs consistently well in the treatment of SCC, and is only rivaled by Ramicane. Despite the competition between the two, they seem fairly equal in the treatment of SCC and reducing the volume of tumors over the course of 45 days.
